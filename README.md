# ThePiggyGame
A psychological experiment

## How to play
* In this game, the user competes against the computer.
* On each turn, the current player rolls a pair of dice and accumulates points.
* The goal is to reach 100 points before your opponent does.
* If, on any turn, the player rolls a 1, all points accumulated for that round are forfeited and control of the dice moves to the other player.
* If the player rolls two 1s in one turn, the player loses all points accumulated thus far in the game and loses control of the dice.
* The player may voluntarily turn over the dice after each roll.
